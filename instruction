Actually for more than 3-4 days I was searching on internet on "how to change the font of jupyter notebook", because I was trying
to give a new look to my notebook editor.
I tried many many many ways to customize my notebook, but I was failed.
After trying may times I found a way to customize jupyter notebook.

for those who have install jupyter notebook through Anaconda-navigator....follow this

Go to this directory 
      home/USERNAME/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/notebook/static/custom  (replace "USERNAME" by your pc username)
      open the custom.css file
      edit whatever you want to see in your jupyter notebook
      
      for example :
      I have added these 2 lines of code to the custom.css file to change my jupyter notebook font:
      
      .CodeMirror{
        font-family: Serif;
        font-size: 18px;
      }
      
      Note: Save the custom.css file and reload the jupyter notebook page.
      
      And BOOM!!!
      THE FONT CHANGED FROM DEFAULT FONT-FAMILY TO SERIF
      
      
      
      #Just trying to help others and get the same in return !
